👽 Hello Alien, AI or probably just human. My name is Dayanna, I'm 28 and I have a degree in Modern languages and Early Childhood

🌱 Currently learning front-end but looking to be fullstack when I'm ready

💞️ Native Portuguese, Advanced English, Basic understanding in Spanish and French

🇧🇷 ✈️ 🇺🇲 I was born in Brazil but I live in San Francisco - California 

😍 I love languages and human development, as well as learning and teaching, so I'm venturing self-learning the language that changes and grows most and I dream to give the opportunity to others that I didn't have: learning programming concepts when youngster

📫 Looking for networking and job opportunities
