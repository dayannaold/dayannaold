- 👋 Hi there, I’m Dayanna, 27yo and I have a degree in Modern languages (Portuguese and English) and Early Childhood Education. 
- 😍 I love languages and human development, as well as learning and teaching, I'm studying by myself before starting a new college or bootcamp, 
also I'm motivated to learn so in the future I can offer an opportunity that I did not have: learn how to code as a children and teenager.
- 🇧🇷 ✈️ :us: I'm from Brazil but I live in the USA, San Francisco - California 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, css, js, python, git and algorithm.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on git repository, friends and increase my knowledge.
